Another powerful feature is the creation of lists. For instance, we can create a bulleted list by having an asterisk in front of every item or a numbered list by putting 1. in front of each item (the numbering will increase automatically).\n",

Your results may vary, but chances are that somewhere near the top will appear a Python 3 Documentation Tutorial on [Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) which refers to the built-in [print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function.

However, an even more accessible page is another of the top results at [Python: Get Today’s Current Date and Time](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-get-current-date-time-in-python/).

Python actually has a relatively small set of built-in functions that don't require importing, especially compared to some other programming languages (like PHP). The ```print()``` function we've already seen is an example of a built-in function. The challenge can be finding the names of the modules and then finding the functions that we want to use.\n",

More formats are listed and explained in the [time.strftime()](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/time.html?highlight=strftime#time.strftime) reference page.\n",

The ```now``` on the left side of this statement isn't a built-in keyword in Python, it's a variable name that the programmer has chosen (a place-holder for a value that can change). Whatever the value of ```time.strftime(\"%c\")``` gets assigned to the variable named ```now```. Note that just assigning a value doesn't mean that it will be displayed (printed), so we'd need to do that explicitly.\n",
